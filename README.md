## A Hybrid Data Science Approach To Technical Analysis
This project aims to create a Hybrid data science methodology that combines technical analysis indicators with deep learning models to enhance the accuracy of stock price predictions. The aim is to capitalize on the benefits of both conventional technical analysis and contemporary data science methods to establish a stronger and more reliable predictive system.
This project aims to answer the following questions:
I.	How can deep learning models effectively utilize technical indicators as input features to predict stock prices?
II.	If deep learning models, and also if the combination of deep learning models produces the most accurate predictions for stock prices better than the traditional methods like Simple Moving Average (SMA)?
This project aims to create a Hybrid data science methodology that combines technical analysis indicators with deep learning models to enhance the accuracy of stock price predictions. The aim is to capitalize on the benefits of both conventional technical analysis and contemporary data science methods to establish a stronger and more reliable predictive system.
The main objectives of this project are as follows:
a)	To predict stock prices using a traditional method like simple moving average (SMA) as a baseline model.

b)	To develop three standalone deep learning models and a hybrid deep learning model that combines technical indicators (such as moving averages, EMA, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and RSI) with deep learning algorithms (such as LSTM, GRU, CNN, and LSTM-CNN).

c)	To Evaluate the performance of the baseline model, the three standalone models, and the hybrid model in Predicting Stock Prices.
